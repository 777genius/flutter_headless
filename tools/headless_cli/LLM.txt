Purpose:
CLI tooling for Headless (token import from W3C + package skeleton generation).

Non-goals:
- No runtime token parsing for apps; code generation only.

Invariants:
- Tooling must generate typed Dart code for tokens (no JSON in runtime).

Correct usage:
- Use CLI to import W3C tokens and generate Dart sources in headless_tokens.
- Use `renderless generate component <name>` to scaffold a new component package.

Anti-patterns:
- Adding UI logic into CLI.
