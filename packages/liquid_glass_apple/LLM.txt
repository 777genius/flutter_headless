# liquid_glass_apple

Cross-platform glassmorphism effect inspired by iOS materials. Uses BackdropFilter for blur + tint effects.

## Key concepts
- Provides `GlassContainer` widget with configurable `GlassStyle` presets (regular, ultraThin, thin).
- Works on all platforms (web, mobile, desktop) but is not a pixel-perfect iOS replica.
- Performance-sensitive: avoid in ListView/scrolling containers; prefer 1-3 instances per screen.

## Public API
- See `lib/liquid_glass_apple.dart` for the barrel export.
