# headless_contracts

Renderer contracts and slot overrides for Headless components.

## Key concepts
- Defines capability contracts (ISP interfaces) that components use to request renderers via `HeadlessTheme.capability<T>()`.
- Renderers implement these contracts to provide visual representation; components never know the concrete renderer.
- Provides slot override mechanisms for customizing parts of a component's visual output.

## Public API
- See `lib/headless_contracts.dart` for the barrel export.
