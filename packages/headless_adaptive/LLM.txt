# headless_adaptive

Adaptive theme helpers for Headless components.

## Key concepts
- Provides `HeadlessAdaptiveApp` that auto-selects MaterialApp or CupertinoApp based on platform (iOS/macOS -> Cupertino, others -> Material).
- Installs the matching headless theme (`MaterialHeadlessTheme` or `CupertinoHeadlessTheme`) and overlay host automatically.
- Supports platform override for deterministic testing.

## Public API
- See `lib/headless_adaptive.dart` for the barrel export.
